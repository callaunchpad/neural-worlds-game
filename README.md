NeRF-Based 3D Modeling for Subway Surfers
=========================================

Project Overview
----------------

This project focuses on leveraging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for efficient 3D object modeling from 2D images. Utilizing cutting-edge tools like InstantNGP, NerfStudio, and Unity, we have developed a pipeline for style transfer and rapid conversion of NeRFs into video game assets, specifically tailored for the popular game Subway Surfers.

Features
--------

-   NeRF-Based 3D Modeling: Using NerfStudio and InstantNGP to create detailed 3D models from 2D images.
-   Unity Integration: Seamless workflow within Unity for integrating 3D models into game environments.
-   Style Transfer: Advanced techniques to adapt the 3D models to match the unique art style of Subway Surfers.
-   NeRF to Mesh Conversion: Utilizing Nerf2Mesh for efficient conversion of NeRF models into usable game assets.
